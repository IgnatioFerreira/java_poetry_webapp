A. E. Housman - The Merry Guide<br />
<br />
Once in the wind of morning<br />
I ranged the thymy wold;<br />
The world-wide air was azure<br />
And all the brooks ran gold.<br />
<br />
There through the dews beside me<br />
Behold a youth that trod,<br />
With feathered cap on forehead,<br />
And poised a golden rod.<br />
<br />
With mien to match the morning<br />
And gay delightful guise<br />
And friendly brows and laughter<br />
He looked me in the eyes.<br />
<br />
Oh whence, I asked, and whither?<br />
He smiled and would not say.<br />
And looked at me and beckoned,<br />
And laughed and led the way.<br />
<br />
And with kind looks and laughter<br />
And nought to say beside,<br />
We two went on together,<br />
I and my happy guide.<br />
<br />
Across the glittering pastures<br />
And empty upland still<br />
And solitude of shepherds<br />
High in the folded hill,<br />
<br />
By hanging woods and hamlets<br />
That gaze through orchards down<br />
On many a windmill turning<br />
And far-discovered town,<br />
<br />
With gay regards of promise<br />
And sure unslackened stride<br />
And smiles and nothing spoken<br />
Led on my merry guide.<br />
<br />
By blowing realms of woodland<br />
With sunstruck vanes afield<br />
And cloud-led shadows sailing<br />
About the windy weald,<br />
<br />
By valley-guarded granges<br />
And silver waters wide,<br />
Content at heart I followed<br />
With my delightful guide.<br />
<br />
And like the cloudy shadows<br />
Across the country blown<br />
We two fare on for ever,<br />
But not we two alone.<br />
<br />
With the great gale we journey<br />
That breathes from gardens thinned,<br />
Borne in the drift of blossoms<br />
Whose petals throng the wind;<br />
<br />
Buoyed on the heaven-ward whisper<br />
Of dancing leaflets whirled<br />
From all the woods that autumn<br />
Bereaves in all the world.<br />
<br />
And midst the fluttering legion<br />
Of all that ever died<br />
I follow, and before us<br />
Goes the delightful guide,<br />
<br />
With lips that brim with laughter<br />
But never once respond,<br />
And feet that fly on feathers,<br />
And serpent-circled wand.
