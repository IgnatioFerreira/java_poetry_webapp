A. E. Housman - 1887<br />
<br />
From Clee to heaven the beacon burns,<br />
The shires have seen it plain,<br />
From north and south the sign returns<br />
And beacons burn again.<br />
<br />
Look left, look right, the hills are bright,<br />
The dales are light between,<br />
Because 'tis fifty years to-night<br />
That God has saved the Queen.<br />
<br />
Now, when the flame they watch not towers<br />
About the soil they trod,<br />
Lads, we'll remember friends of ours<br />
Who shared the work with God.<br />
<br />
To skies that knit their heartstrings right,<br />
To fields that bred them brave,<br />
The saviours come not home to-night:<br />
Themselves they could not save.<br />
<br />
It dawns in Asia, tombstones show<br />
And Shropshire names are read;<br />
And the Nile spills his overflow<br />
Beside the Severn's dead.<br />
<br />
We pledge in peace by farm and town<br />
The Queen they served in war,<br />
And fire the beacons up and down<br />
The land they perished for.<br />
<br />
"God save the Queen" we living sing,<br />
From height to height 'tis heard;<br />
And with the rest your voices ring,<br />
Lads of the Fifty-third.<br />
<br />
Oh, God will save her, fear you not:<br />
Be you the men you've been,<br />
Get you the sons your fathers got,<br />
And God will save the Queen.
