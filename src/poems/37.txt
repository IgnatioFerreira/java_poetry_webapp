A. E. Housman - On Moonlit Heath and Lonesome Bank<br />
<br />
On moonlit heath and lonesome bank<br />
The sheep beside me graze;<br />
And yon the gallows used to clank<br />
Fast by the four cross ways.<br />
<br />
A careless shepherd once would keep<br />
The flocks by moonlight there,        *<br />
And high amongst the glimmering sheep<br />
The dead man stood on air.<br />
<br />
They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:<br />
The whistles blow forlorn,<br />
And trains all night groan on the rail<br />
To men that die at morn.<br />
<br />
There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night,<br />
Or wakes, as may betide,<br />
A better lad, if things went right,<br />
Than most that sleep outside.<br />
<br />
And naked to the hangman's noose<br />
The morning clocks will ring<br />
A neck God made for other use<br />
Than strangling in a string.<br />
<br />
And sharp the link of life will snap,<br />
And dead on air will stand<br />
Heels that held up as straight a chap<br />
As treads upon the land.<br />
<br />
So here I'll watch the night and wait<br />
To see the morning shine,<br />
When he will hear the stroke of eight<br />
And not the stroke of nine;<br />
<br />
And wish my friend as sound a sleep<br />
As lads' I did not know,<br />
That shepherded the moonlit sheep<br />
A hundred years ago.
