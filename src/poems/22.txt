A. E. Housman - Into My Heart an Air that Kills<br />
<br />
Into my heart an air that kills<br />
From yon far country blows:<br />
What are those blue remembered hills,<br />
What spires, what farms are those?<br />
<br />
That is the land of lost content,<br />
I see it shining plain,<br />
The happy highways where I went<br />
And cannot come again.
