A. E. Housman - Oh fair enough are sky and plain<br />
<br />
Oh fair enough are sky and plain,<br />
  But I know fairer far:<br />
Those are as beautiful again<br />
  That in the water are;<br />
<br />
The pools and rivers wash so clean<br />
  The trees and clouds and air,<br />
The like on earth was never seen,<br />
  And oh that I were there.<br />
<br />
These are the thoughts I often think<br />
  As I stand gazing down<br />
In act upon the cressy brink<br />
  To strip and dive and drown;<br />
<br />
But in the golden-sanded brooks<br />
  And azure meres I spy<br />
A silly lad that longs and looks<br />
  And wishes he were I.
