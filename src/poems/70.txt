A. E. Housman - This Time of Year a Twelvemonth Past<br />
<br />
This time of year a twelvemonth past,<br />
When Fred and I would meet,<br />
We needs must jangle, till at last<br />
We fought and I was beat.<br />
<br />
So then the summer fields about,<br />
Till rainy days began,<br />
Rose Harland on her Sundays out<br />
Walked with the better man.<br />
<br />
The better man she walks with still,<br />
Though now 'tis not with Fred:<br />
A lad that lives and has his will<br />
Is worth a dozen dead.<br />
<br />
Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather,<br />
And clay's the house he keeps;<br />
When Rose and I walk out together<br />
Stock-still lies Fred and sleeps.
