A. E. Housman - Tis Time, I Think, By Wenlock Town<br />
<br />
'Tis time, I think, by Wenlock town<br />
The golden broom should blow;<br />
The hawthorn sprinkled up and down<br />
Should charge the land with snow.<br />
<br />
Spring will not wait the loiterer's time<br />
Who keeps so long away;<br />
So others wear the broom and climb<br />
The hedgerows heaped with may.<br />
<br />
Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge,<br />
Gold that I never see;<br />
Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge<br />
That will not shower on me.
