A. E. Housman - The Chestnut Casts His Flambeaux<br />
<br />
The chestnut casts his flambe aux, and the flowers<br />
Stream from the hawthorn on the wind away,<br />
The doors clap to, the pane is blind with showers.<br />
Pass me the can, lad; there's an end of May.<br />
<br />
There's one spoilt spring to scant our mortal lot,<br />
One season ruined of your little store.<br />
May will be fine next year as like as not:<br />
But Au, but then we shall be twenty-four.<br />
<br />
We for a certainty are not the first<br />
Have sat in taverns while the tempest hurled<br />
Their hopeful plans to emptiness, and cursed<br />
Whatever brute and blackguard made the world.<br />
<br />
It is in truth iniquity on high<br />
To cheat our sentenced souls of aught they crave,<br />
And mar the merriment as you and I<br />
Fare on our long fool's-errand to the grave.<br />
<br />
Iniquity it is; but pass the can.<br />
My lad, no pair of kings our mothers bore;<br />
Our only portion is the estate of man:<br />
We want the moon, but we shall get no more.<br />
<br />
If here to-day the cloud of thunder lours<br />
To-morrow it will hie on far behests;<br />
The flesh will grieve on other bones than ours<br />
Soon, and the soul will mourn in other breasts.<br />
<br />
The troubles of our proud and angry dust<br />
Are from eternity, and shall not fail.<br />
Bear them we can, and if we can we must.<br />
Shoulder the sky, my lad, and drink your ale.
