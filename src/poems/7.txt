A. E. Housman - Could Man Be Drunk Forever<br />
<br />
Could man be drunk for ever<br />
With liquor, love, or fights,<br />
Lief should I rouse at morning<br />
And lief lie down of nights.<br />
<br />
But men at whiles are sober<br />
And think by fits and starts,<br />
And if they think, they fasten<br />
Their hands upon their hearts.
