A. E. Housman - Oh, when I was in love with you<br />
<br />
Oh, when I was in love with you,<br />
Then I was clean and brave,<br />
And miles around the wonder grew<br />
How well did I behave.<br />
<br />
And now the fancy passes by,<br />
And nothing will remain,<br />
And miles around they'll say that I<br />
Am quite myself again.
