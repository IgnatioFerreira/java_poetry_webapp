A. E. Housman - When I Was One-and-Twenty<br />
<br />
When I was one-and-twenty<br />
   I heard a wise man say,<br />
"Give crowns and pounds and guineas<br />
   But not your heart away;<br />
Give pearls away and rubies<br />
   But keep your fancy free."<br />
But I was one-and-twenty,<br />
   No use to talk to me.<br />
<br />
When I was one-and-twenty<br />
   I heard him say again,<br />
"The heart out of the bosom<br />
   Was never given in vain;<br />
'Tis paid with sighs a plenty<br />
   And sold for endless rue."<br />
And I am two-and-twenty,<br />
   And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.
