A. E. Housman - On Wenlock Edge The Wood's In Trouble<br />
<br />
On Wenlock Edge the wood's in trouble;<br />
His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves;<br />
The gale, it plies the saplings double,<br />
And thick on Severn snow the leaves.<br />
<br />
'Twould blow like this through holt and hanger<br />
When Uricon the city stood;<br />
'Tis the old wind in the old anger,<br />
But then it threshed another wood.<br />
<br />
Then, 'twas before my time, the Roman<br />
At yonder heaving hill would stare;<br />
The blood that warms an English yeoman,<br />
The thoughts that hurt him, they were there.<br />
<br />
There, like the wind through woods in riot,<br />
Through him the gale of life blew high;<br />
The tree of man was never quiet:<br />
Then 'twas the Roman, now 'tis I.<br />
<br />
The gale, it plies the saplings double,<br />
It blows so hard, 'twill soon be gone:<br />
Today the Roman and his trouble<br />
Are ashes under Uricon.
