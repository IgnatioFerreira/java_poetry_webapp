A. E. Housman - When the Lad for Longing Sighs<br />
<br />
When the lad for longing sighs,<br />
Mute and dull of cheer and pale,<br />
If at death's own door he lies,<br />
Maiden, you can heal his ail.<br />
<br />
Lovers' ills are all to buy:<br />
The wan look, the hollow tone,<br />
The hung head, the sunken eye,<br />
You can have them for your own.<br />
<br />
Buy them, buy them: eve and morn<br />
Lovers' ills are all to sell.<br />
Then you can lie down forlorn;<br />
But the lover will be well.
