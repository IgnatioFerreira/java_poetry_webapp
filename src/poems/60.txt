A. E. Housman - The New Mistress<br />
<br />
"Oh, sick I am to see you, will you never let me be?<br />
You may be good for something, but you are not good for me.<br />
Oh, go where you are wanted, for you are not wanted here.<br />
And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear.<br />
<br />
"I will go where I am wanted, to a lady born and bred<br />
Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red;<br />
She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean:<br />
I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen.<br />
<br />
"I will go where I am wanted, for the sergeant does not mind;<br />
He may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind:<br />
He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap,<br />
And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap.<br />
<br />
"I will go where I am wanted, where there's room for one or two,<br />
And the men are none too many for the work there is to do;<br />
Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick;<br />
And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick."
