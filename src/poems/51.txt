A. E. Housman - The Day of Battle<br />
<br />
"Far I hear the bugle blow<br />
To call me where I would not go,<br />
And the guns begin the song,<br />
'Soldier, fly or stay for long.'<br />
<br />
"Comrade, if to turn and fly<br />
Made a soldier never die,<br />
Fly I would, for who would not?<br />
'Tis sure no pleasure to be shot.<br />
<br />
"But since the man that runs away<br />
Lives to die another day,<br />
And cowards' funerals, when they come,<br />
Are not wept so well at home,<br />
<br />
"Therefore, though the best is bad,<br />
Stand and do the best, my lad;<br />
Stand and fight and see your slain,<br />
And take the bullet in your brain."
