A. E. Housman - Tell me not here, it needs not saying<br />
<br />
Tell me not here, it needs not saying,<br />
  What tune the enchantress plays<br />
In aftermaths of soft September<br />
  Or under blanching mays,<br />
For she and I were long acquainted<br />
  And I knew all her ways.<br />
<br />
On russet floors, by waters idle,<br />
  The pine lets fall its cone;<br />
The cuckoo shouts all day at nothing<br />
  In leafy dells alone;<br />
And traveller’s joy beguiles in autumn<br />
  Hearts that have lost their own.<br />
<br />
On acres of the seeded grasses<br />
  The changing burnish heaves;<br />
Or marshalled under moons of harvest<br />
  Stand still all night the sheaves;<br />
Or beeches strip in storms for winter<br />
  And stain the wind with leaves.<br />
<br />
Posses, as I possessed a season,<br />
  The countries I resign,<br />
Where over elmy plains the highway<br />
  Would mount the hills and shine,<br />
And full of shade the pillared forest<br />
  Would murmur and be mine.<br />
<br />
For nature, heartless, witless nature,<br />
  Will neither care nor know<br />
What stranger’s feet may find the meadow<br />
  And trespass there and go,<br />
Nor ask amid the dews of morning<br />
  If they are mine or no.
