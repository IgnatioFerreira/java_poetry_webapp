A. E. Housman - In Valleys of Springs and Rivers<br />
<br />
"Clunton and Clunbury,<br />
 Clungunford and Clun,<br />
Are the quietest places<br />
 Under the sun."<br />
<br />
<br />
In valleys of springs and rivers,<br />
By Ony and Teme and Clun,<br />
The country for easy livers,<br />
The quietest under the sun,<br />
<br />
We still had sorrows to lighten,<br />
One could not be always glad,<br />
And lads knew trouble at Knighton<br />
When I was a Knighton lad.<br />
<br />
By bridges that Thames runs under,<br />
In London, the town built ill,<br />
'Tis sure small matter for wonder<br />
If sorrow is with one still.<br />
<br />
And if as a lad grows older<br />
The troubles he bears are more,<br />
He carries his griefs on a shoulder<br />
That handselled them long before.<br />
<br />
Where shall one halt to deliver<br />
This luggage I'd lief set down?<br />
Not Thames, not Teme is the river,<br />
Nor London nor Knighton the town:<br />
<br />
'Tis a long way further than Knighton,<br />
A quieter place than Clun,<br />
Where doomsday may thunder and lighten<br />
And little 'twill matter to one.
