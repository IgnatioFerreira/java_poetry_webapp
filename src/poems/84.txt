A. R. Ammons - An Improvisation For Angular Momentum<br />
<br />
Walking is like<br />
imagination, a<br />
single step<br />
dissolves the circle<br />
into motion; the eye here<br />
and there rests<br />
on a leaf,<br />
gap, or ledge,<br />
everything flowing<br />
except where<br />
sight touches seen:<br />
stop, though, and<br />
reality snaps back<br />
in, locked hard,<br />
forms sharply<br />
themselves, bushbank,<br />
dentree, phoneline,<br />
definite, fixed,<br />
the self, too, then<br />
caught real, clouds<br />
and wind melting<br />
into their directions,<br />
breaking around and<br />
over, down and out,<br />
motions profound,<br />
alive, musical!<br />
<br />
Perhaps the death mother like the birth mother<br />
does not desert us but comes to tend<br />
and produce us, to make room for us<br />
and bear us tenderly, considerately,<br />
through the gates, to see us through,<br />
to ease our pains, quell our cries,<br />
to hover over and nestle us, to deliver<br />
us into the greatest, most enduring<br />
peace, all the way past the bother of<br />
recollection,<br />
beyond the finework of frailty,<br />
the mishmash house of the coming & going,<br />
creation's fringes,<br />
the eddies and curlicues
