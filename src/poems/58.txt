A. E. Housman - The Lent Lily<br />
<br />
'Tis spring; come out to ramble<br />
  The hilly brakes around,<br />
For under thorn and bramble<br />
  About the hollow ground<br />
  The primroses are found.<br />
<br />
And there's the windflower chilly<br />
  With all the winds at play,<br />
And there's the Lenten lily<br />
  That has not long to stay<br />
  And dies on Easter day.<br />
<br />
And since till girls go maying<br />
  You find the primrose still,<br />
And find the windflower playing<br />
  With every wind at will,<br />
  But not the daffodil,<br />
<br />
Bring baskets now, and sally<br />
  Upon the spring's array,<br />
And bear from hill and valley<br />
  The daffodil away<br />
  That dies on Easter day.
