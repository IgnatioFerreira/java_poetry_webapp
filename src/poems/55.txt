A. E. Housman - The Isle of Portland<br />
<br />
The star-filled seas are smooth to-night<br />
From France to England strown;<br />
Black towers above the Portland light<br />
The felon-quarried stone.<br />
<br />
On yonder island, not to rise,<br />
Never to stir forth free,<br />
Far from his folk a dead lad lies<br />
That once was friends with me.<br />
<br />
Lie you easy, dream you light,<br />
And sleep you fast for aye;<br />
And luckier may you find the night<br />
Than ever you found the day.
