A. E. Housman - The Stinging Nettle<br />
<br />
The stinging nettle only<br />
Will still be found to stand:<br />
The numberless, the lonely,<br />
The thronger of the land,<br />
The leaf that hurts the hand.<br />
<br />
That thrives, come sun, come showers;<br />
Blow east, blow west, it springs;<br />
It peoples towns, and towers<br />
Above the courts of Kings,<br />
And touch it and it stings.
