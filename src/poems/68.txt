A. E. Housman - There Pass the Careless People<br />
<br />
There pass the careless people<br />
That call their souls their own:<br />
Here by the road I loiter,<br />
How idle and alone.<br />
<br />
Ah, past the plunge of plummet,<br />
In seas I cannot sound,<br />
My heart and soul and senses,<br />
World without end, are drowned.<br />
<br />
His folly has not fellow<br />
Beneath the blue of day<br />
That gives to man or woman<br />
His heart and soul away.<br />
<br />
There flowers no balm to sain him<br />
From east of earth to west<br />
That's lost for everlasting<br />
The heart out of his breast.<br />
<br />
Here by the labouring highway<br />
With empty hands I stroll:<br />
Sea-deep, till doomsday morning,<br />
Lie lost my heart and soul.
