A. E. Housman - Far In a Western Brookland<br />
<br />
Far in a western brookland<br />
That bred me long ago<br />
The poplars stand and tremble<br />
By pools I used to know.<br />
<br />
There, in the windless night-time,<br />
The wanderer, marvelling why,<br />
Halts on the bridge to hearken<br />
How soft the poplars sigh.<br />
<br />
He hears: no more remembered<br />
In fields where I was known,<br />
Here I lie down in London<br />
And turn to rest alone.<br />
<br />
There, by the starlit fences,<br />
The wanderer halts and hears<br />
My soul that lingers sighing<br />
About the glimmering weirs.
