A. E. Housman - Farewell to Barn and Stack and Tree<br />
<br />
"Farewell to barn and stack and tree,<br />
Farewell to Severn shore.<br />
Terence, look your last at me,<br />
For I come home no more.<br />
<br />
"The sun burns on the half-mown hill,<br />
By now the blood is dried;<br />
And Maurice amongst the hay lies still<br />
And my knife is in his side.<br />
<br />
"My mother thinks us long away;<br />
'Tis time the field were mown.<br />
She had two sons at rising day,<br />
To-night she'll be alone.<br />
<br />
"And here's a bloody hand to shake,<br />
And oh, man, here's good-bye;<br />
We'll sweat no more on scythe and rake,<br />
My bloody hands and I.<br />
<br />
"I wish you strength to bring you pride,<br />
And a love to keep you clean,<br />
And I wish you luck, come Lammastide,<br />
At racing on the green.<br />
<br />
"Long for me the rick will wait,<br />
And long will wait the fold,<br />
And long will stand the empty plate,<br />
And dinner will be cold."
