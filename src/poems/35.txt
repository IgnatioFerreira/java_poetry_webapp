A. E. Housman - Oh, see how thick the goldcup flowers<br />
<br />
Oh, see how thick the goldcup flowers<br />
  Are lying in field and lane,<br />
With dandelions to tell the hours<br />
  That never are told again.<br />
Oh may I squire you round the meads<br />
  And pick you posies gay?<br />
--'Twill do no harm to take my arm.<br />
  'You may, young man, you may.'<br />
<br />
Ah, spring was sent for lass and lad,<br />
  'Tis now the blood runs gold,<br />
And man and maid had best be glad<br />
  Before the world is old.<br />
What flowers to-day may flower to-morrow,<br />
  But never as good as new.<br />
--Suppose I wound my arm right round--<br />
  ''Tis true, young man, 'tis true.'<br />
<br />
Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say,<br />
  That only court to thieve,<br />
And once they bear the bloom away<br />
  'Tis little enough they leave.<br />
Then keep your heart for men like me<br />
  And safe from trustless chaps.<br />
My love is true and all for you.<br />
  'Perhaps, young man, perhaps.'<br />
<br />
Oh, look in my eyes then, can you doubt?<br />
  --Why, 'tis a mile from town.<br />
How green the grass is all about!<br />
  We might as well sit down.<br />
--Ah, life, what is it but a flower?<br />
  Why must true lovers sigh?<br />
Be kind, have pity, my own, my pretty,--<br />
  'Good-bye, young man, good-bye.'
