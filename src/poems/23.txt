A. E. Housman - Is My Team Ploughing<br />
<br />
"Is my team ploughing,<br />
That I was used to drive<br />
And hear the harness jingle<br />
When I was man alive?"<br />
<br />
Ay, the horses trample,<br />
The harness jingles now;<br />
No change though you lie under<br />
The land you used to plough.<br />
<br />
"Is football playing<br />
Along the river shore,<br />
With lads to chase the leather,<br />
Now I stand up no more?"<br />
<br />
Ay, the ball is flying,<br />
The lads play heart and soul;<br />
The goal stands up, the keeper<br />
Stands up to keep the goal.<br />
<br />
"Is my girl happy,<br />
That I thought hard to leave,<br />
And has she tired of weeping<br />
As she lies down at eve?"<br />
<br />
Ay, she lies down lightly,<br />
She lies not down to weep,<br />
Your girl is well contented.<br />
Be still, my lad, and sleep.<br />
<br />
"Is my friend hearty,<br />
Now I am thin and pine,<br />
And has he found to sleep in<br />
A better bed than mine?"<br />
<br />
Yes, lad, I lie easy,<br />
I lie as lads would choose;<br />
I cheer a dead man's sweetheart,<br />
Never ask me whose.
