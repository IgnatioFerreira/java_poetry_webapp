A. E. Housman - To an Athlete Dying Young<br />
<br />
The time you won your town the race<br />
We chaired you through the market-place;<br />
Man and boy stood cheering by,<br />
And home we brought you shoulder-high.<br />
<br />
To-day, the road all runners come,<br />
Shoulder-high we bring you home,<br />
And set you at your threshold down,<br />
Townsman of a stiller town.<br />
<br />
Smart lad, to slip betimes away<br />
From fields where glory does not stay<br />
And early though the laurel grows<br />
It withers quicker than the rose.<br />
<br />
Eyes the shady night has shut<br />
Cannot see the record cut,<br />
And silence sounds no worse than cheers<br />
After earth has stopped the ears:<br />
<br />
Now you will not swell the rout<br />
Of lads that wore their honours out,<br />
Runners whom renown outran<br />
And the name died before the man.<br />
<br />
So set, before its echoes fade,<br />
The fleet foot on the sill of shade,<br />
And hold to the low lintel up<br />
The still-defended challenge-cup.<br />
<br />
And round that early-laurelled head<br />
Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,<br />
And find unwithered on its curls<br />
The garland briefer than a girl's.
