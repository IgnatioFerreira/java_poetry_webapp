A. E. Housman - In My Own Shire, If I Was Sad<br />
<br />
In my own shire, if I was sad,<br />
Homely comforters I had:<br />
The earth, because my heart was sore,<br />
Sorrowed for the son she bore;<br />
And standing hills, long to remain,<br />
Shared their short-lived comrade's pain.<br />
And bound for the same bourn as I,<br />
On every road I wandered by,<br />
Trod beside me, close and dear,<br />
The beautiful and death-struck year:<br />
Whether in the woodland brown<br />
I heard the beechnut rustle down,<br />
And saw the purple crocus pale<br />
Flower about the autumn dale;<br />
Or littering far the fields of May<br />
Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay,<br />
And like a skylit water stood<br />
The bluebells in the azured wood.<br />
<br />
Yonder, lightening other loads,<br />
The seasons range the country roads,<br />
But here in London streets I ken<br />
No such helpmates, only men;<br />
And these are not in plight to bear,<br />
If they would, another's care.<br />
They have enough as 'tis: I see<br />
In many an eye that measures me<br />
The mortal sickness of a mind<br />
Too unhappy to be kind.<br />
Undone with misery, all they can<br />
Is to hate their fellow man;<br />
And till they drop they needs must still<br />
Look at you and wish you ill.
