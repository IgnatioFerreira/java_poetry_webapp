A. E. Housman - The Welsh Marches<br />
<br />
High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam<br />
Islanded in Severn stream;<br />
The bridges from the steepled crest<br />
Cross the water east and west.<br />
<br />
The flag of morn in conqueror's state<br />
Enters at the English gate:<br />
The vanquished eve, as night prevails,<br />
Bleeds upon the road to Wales.<br />
<br />
Ages since the vanquished bled<br />
Round my mother's marriage-bed;<br />
There the ravens feasted far<br />
About the open house of war:<br />
<br />
When Severn down to Buildwas ran<br />
Coloured with the death of man,<br />
Couched upon her brother's grave<br />
That Saxon got me on the slave.<br />
<br />
The sound of fight is silent long<br />
That began the ancient wrong;<br />
Long the voice of tears is still<br />
That wept of old the endless ill.<br />
<br />
In my heart it has not died,<br />
The war that sleeps on Severn side;<br />
They cease not fighting, east and west,<br />
On the marches of my breat.<br />
<br />
Here the truceless armies yet<br />
Trample, rolled in blood and sweat;<br />
They kill and kill and never die;<br />
And I think that each is I.<br />
<br />
None will part us, none undo<br />
The knot that makes one flesh of two,<br />
Sick with hatred, sick with pain,<br />
Strangling-- When shall we be slain?<br />
<br />
When shall I be dead and rid<br />
Of the wrong my father did?<br />
How long, how long, till spade and hearse<br />
Puts to sleep my mother's curse?
