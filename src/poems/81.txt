A. E. Housman - White in the Moon the Long Road Lies<br />
<br />
White in the moon the long road lies,<br />
The moon stands blank above;<br />
White in the moon the long road lies<br />
That leads me from my love.<br />
<br />
Still hangs the hedge without a gust,<br />
Still, still the shadows stay:<br />
My feet upon the moonlit dust<br />
Pursue the ceaseless way.<br />
<br />
The world is round, so travellers tell,<br />
And straight though reach the track,<br />
Trudge on, trudge on, 'twill all be well,<br />
The way will guide one back.<br />
<br />
But ere the circle homeward hies<br />
Far, far must it remove:<br />
White in the moon the long road lies<br />
That leads me from my love.
