A. E. Housman - The Laws of God, The Laws of Man<br />
<br />
The laws of God, the laws of man,<br />
He may keep that will and can;<br />
Not I: let God and man decree<br />
Laws for themselves and not for me;<br />
And if my ways are not as theirs<br />
Let them mind their own affairs.<br />
Their deeds I judge and much condemn,<br />
Yet when did I make laws for them?<br />
Please yourselves, say I, and they<br />
Need only look the other way.<br />
But no, they will not; they must still<br />
Wrest their neighbor to their will,<br />
And make me dance as they desire<br />
With jail and gallows and hell-fire.<br />
And how am I to face the odds<br />
Of man's bedevilment and God's?<br />
I, a stranger and afraid<br />
In a world I never made.<br />
They will be master, right or wrong;<br />
Though both are foolish, both are strong.<br />
And since, my soul, we cannot fly<br />
To Saturn nor to Mercury,<br />
Keep we must, if keep we can,<br />
These foreign laws of God and man.
