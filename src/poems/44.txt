A. E. Housman - Shot? So Quick, So Clean an Ending?<br />
<br />
Shot? so quick, so clean an ending?<br />
Oh that was right, lad, that was brave:<br />
Yours was not an ill for mending,<br />
'Twas best to take it to the grave.<br />
<br />
Oh you had forethought, you could reason,<br />
And saw your road and where it led,<br />
And early wise and brave in season<br />
Put the pistol to your head.<br />
<br />
Oh soon, and better so than later<br />
After long disgrace and scorn,<br />
You shot dead the household traitor,<br />
The soul that should not have been born.<br />
<br />
Right you guessed the rising morrow<br />
And scorned to tread the mire you must:<br />
Dust's your wages, son of sorrow,<br />
But men may come to worse than dust.<br />
<br />
Souls undone, undoing others,--<br />
Long time since the tale began.<br />
You would not live to wrong your brothers:<br />
Oh lad, you died as fits a man.<br />
<br />
Now to your grave shall friend and stranger<br />
With ruth and some with envy come:<br />
Undishonoured, clear of danger,<br />
Clean of guilt, pass hence and home.<br />
<br />
Turn safe to rest, no dreams, no waking;<br />
And here, man, here's the wreath I've made:<br />
'Tis not a gift that's worth the taking,<br />
But wear it and it will not fade.
