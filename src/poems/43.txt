A. E. Housman - Say, Lad, Have You Things to Do?<br />
<br />
Say, lad, have you things to do?<br />
Quick then, while your day's at prime.<br />
Quick, and if 'tis work for two,<br />
Here am I man: now's your time.<br />
<br />
Send me now, and I shall go;<br />
Call me, I shall hear you call;<br />
Use me ere they lay me low<br />
Where a man's no use at all;<br />
<br />
Ere the wholesome flesh decay<br />
And the willing nerve be numb,<br />
And the lips lack breath to say,<br />
"No, my lad, I cannot come."
