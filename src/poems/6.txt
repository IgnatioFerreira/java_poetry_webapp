A. E. Housman - Bring, In This Timeless Grave to Throw<br />
<br />
Bring, in this timeless grave to throw,<br />
No cypress, sombre on the snow;<br />
Snap not from the bitter yew<br />
His leaves that live December through;<br />
Break no rosemary, bright with rime<br />
And sparkling to the cruel clime;<br />
Nor plod the winter land to look<br />
For willows in the icy brook<br />
To cast them leafless round him: bring<br />
No spray that ever buds in spring.<br />
<br />
But if the Christmas field has kept<br />
Awns the last gleaner overstept,<br />
Or shrivelled flax, whose flower is blue<br />
A single season, never two;<br />
Or if one haulm whose year is o'er<br />
Shivers on the upland frore,<br />
--Oh, bring from hill and stream and plain<br />
Whatever will not flower again,<br />
To give him comfort: he and those<br />
Shall bide eternal bedfellows<br />
Where low upon the couch he lies<br />
Whence he never shall arise.
