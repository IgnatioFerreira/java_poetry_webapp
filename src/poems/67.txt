A. E. Housman - The Winds Out of the West Land Blow<br />
<br />
The winds out of the west land blow,<br />
My friends have breathed them there;<br />
Warm with the blood of lads I know<br />
Comes east the sighing air.<br />
<br />
It fanned their temples, filled their lungs,<br />
Scattered their forelocks free;<br />
My friends made words of it with tongues<br />
That talk no more to me.<br />
<br />
Their voices, dying as they fly,<br />
Thick on the wind are sown;<br />
The names of men blow soundless by,<br />
My fellows' and my own.<br />
<br />
Oh lads, at home I heard you plain,<br />
But here your speech is still,<br />
And down the sighing wind in vain<br />
You hollo from the hill.<br />
<br />
The wind and I, we both were there,<br />
But neither long abode;<br />
Now through the friendless world we fare<br />
And sigh upon the road.
