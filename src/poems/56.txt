A. E. Housman - The Lads in Their Hundreds<br />
<br />
The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair,<br />
There's men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold,<br />
The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there,<br />
And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old.<br />
<br />
There's chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart,<br />
And many to count are the stalwart, and many the brave,<br />
And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart,<br />
And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave.<br />
<br />
I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell<br />
The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern;<br />
And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell<br />
And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.<br />
<br />
But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan;<br />
And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told<br />
They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,<br />
The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.
