A. E. Housman - As Through the Wild Green Hills of Wyre<br />
<br />
As through the wild green hills of Wyre<br />
The train ran, changing sky and shire,<br />
And far behind, a fading crest,<br />
Low in the forsaken west<br />
Sank the high-reared head of Clee,<br />
My hand lay empty on my knee.<br />
Aching on my knee it lay:<br />
That morning half a shire away<br />
So many an honest fellow's fist<br />
Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist.<br />
Hand, said I, since now we part<br />
From fields and men we know by heart,<br />
For strangers' faces, strangers' lands,--<br />
Hand, you have held true fellows' hands.<br />
Be clean then; rot before you do<br />
A thing they'll not believe of you.<br />
You and I must keep from shame<br />
In London streets the Shropshire name;<br />
On banks of Thames they must not say<br />
Severn breeds worse men than they;<br />
And friends abroad must bear in mind<br />
Friends at home they leave behind.<br />
Oh, I shall be stiff and cold<br />
When I forget you, hearts of gold;<br />
The land where I shall mind you not<br />
Is the land where all's forgot.<br />
And if my foot returns no more<br />
To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore,<br />
Luck, my lads, be with you still<br />
By falling stream and standing hill,<br />
By chiming tower and whispering tree,<br />
Men that made a man of me.<br />
About your work in town and farm<br />
Still you'll keep my head from harm,<br />
Still you'll help me, hands that gave<br />
A grasp to friend me to the grave.
