A. E. Housman - The Immortal Part<br />
<br />
When I meet the morning beam,<br />
Or lay me down at night to dream,<br />
I hear my bones within me say,<br />
"Another night, another day.<br />
<br />
"When shall this slough of sense be cast,<br />
This dust of thoughts be laid at last,<br />
The man of flesh and soul be slain<br />
And the man of bone remain?<br />
<br />
"This tongue that talks, these lungs that shout,<br />
These thews that hustle us about,<br />
This brain that fills the skull with schemes,<br />
And its humming hive of dreams,--<br />
<br />
"These to-day are proud in power<br />
And lord it in their little hour:<br />
The immortal bones obey control<br />
Of dying flesh and dying soul.<br />
<br />
"'Tis long till eve and morn are gone:<br />
Slow the endless night comes on,<br />
And late to fulness grows the birth<br />
That shall last as long as earth.<br />
<br />
"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west,<br />
Know you why you cannot rest?<br />
'Tis that every mother's son<br />
Travails with a skeleton.<br />
<br />
"Lie down in the bed of dust;<br />
Bear the fruit that bear you must;<br />
Bring the eternal seed to light,<br />
And morn is all the same as night.<br />
<br />
"Rest you so from trouble sore,<br />
Fear the heat o' the sun no more,<br />
Nor the snowing winter wild,<br />
Now you labour not with child.<br />
<br />
"Empty vessel, garment cast,<br />
We that wore you long shall last.<br />
--Another night, another day."<br />
So my bones within me say.<br />
<br />
Therefore they shall do my will<br />
To-day while I am master still,<br />
And flesh and soul, now both are strong,<br />
Shall hale the sullen slaves along,<br />
<br />
Before this fire of sense decay,<br />
This smoke of thought blow clean away,<br />
And leave with ancient night alone<br />
The steadfast and enduring bone.
