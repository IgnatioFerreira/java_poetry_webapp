A. E. Housman - O Why Do You Walk (a Parody)<br />
<br />
O why do you walk through the fields in boots,<br />
     Missing so much and so much?<br />
O fat white woman whom nobody shoots,<br />
Why do you walk through the fields in boots,<br />
When the grass is soft as the breast of coots<br />
     And shivering-sweet to the touch?
