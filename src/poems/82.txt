A. E. Housman - With rue my heart is laden<br />
<br />
With rue my heart is laden<br />
 For golden friends I had,<br />
For many a rose-lipt maiden<br />
 And many a lightfoot lad.<br />
<br />
By brooks too broad for leaping<br />
 The lightfoot boys are laid;<br />
The rose-lipt girls are sleeping<br />
 In fields where roses fade.
