A. E. Housman - Be Still, My Soul, Be Still<br />
<br />
Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle,<br />
Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong.<br />
Think rather,-- call to thought, if now you grieve a little,<br />
The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long.<br />
<br />
Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry<br />
I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn;<br />
Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry:<br />
Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born.<br />
<br />
Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason,<br />
I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun.<br />
Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season:<br />
Let us endure an hour and see injustice done.<br />
<br />
Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation;<br />
All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain:<br />
Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation--<br />
Oh why did I awake? when shall I sleep again?
