A. E. Housman - The Street Sounds to the Soldiers' Tread<br />
<br />
The street sounds to the soldiers' tread,<br />
And out we troop to see:<br />
A single redcoat turns his head,<br />
He turns and looks at me.<br />
<br />
My man, from sky to sky's so far,<br />
We never crossed before;<br />
Such leagues apart the world's ends are,<br />
We're like to meet no more;<br />
<br />
What thoughts at heart have you and I<br />
We cannot stop to tell;<br />
But dead or living, drunk or dry,<br />
Soldier, I wish you well.
