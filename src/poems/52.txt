A. E. Housman - The Fairies Break Their Dances<br />
<br />
The fairies break their dances<br />
And leave the printed lawn,<br />
And up from India glances<br />
The silver sail of dawn.<br />
<br />
The candles burn their sockets,<br />
The blinds let through the day,<br />
The young man feels his pockets<br />
And wonders what's to pay.
