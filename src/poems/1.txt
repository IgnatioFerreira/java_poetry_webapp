A. E. Housman - Along the field as we came by<br />
<br />
ALONG the field as we came by  <br />
A year ago, my love and I,  <br />
The aspen over stile and stone  <br />
Was talking to itself alone.  <br />
‘Oh who are these that kiss and pass?<br />
A country lover and his lass;  <br />
Two lovers looking to be wed;  <br />
And time shall put them both to bed,  <br />
But she shall lie with earth above,  <br />
And he beside another love.’<br />
 <br />
 And sure enough beneath the tree  <br />
There walks another love with me,  <br />
And overhead the aspen heaves  <br />
Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;  <br />
And I spell nothing in their stir,<br />
But now perhaps they speak to her,  <br />
And plain for her to understand  <br />
They talk about a time at hand  <br />
When I shall sleep with clover clad,  <br />
And she beside another lad.
