A. E. Housman - Bredon Hill<br />
<br />
In summertime on Bredon<br />
The bells they sound so clear;<br />
Round both the shires they ring them<br />
In steeples far and near,<br />
A happy noise to hear.<br />
<br />
Here of a Sunday morning<br />
My love and I would lie,<br />
And see the coloured counties,<br />
And hear the larks so high<br />
About us in the sky.<br />
<br />
The bells would ring to call her<br />
In valleys miles away:<br />
'Come all to church, good people;<br />
Good people, come and pray.<br />
But here my love would stay.<br />
<br />
And I would turn and answer<br />
Among the springing thyme,<br />
'Oh, peal upon our wedding,<br />
And we will hear the chime,<br />
And come to church in time.<br />
<br />
But when the snows at Christmas<br />
On Bredon top were strewn,<br />
My love rose up so early<br />
And stole out unbeknown<br />
And went to church alone.<br />
<br />
They tolled the one bell only,<br />
Groom there was none to see,<br />
The mourners followed after,<br />
And so to church went she,<br />
And would not wait for me.<br />
<br />
The bells they sound on Bredon,<br />
And still the steeples hum.<br />
'Come all to church, good people,' -<br />
Oh, noisy bells, be dumb;<br />
I hear you, I will come.
