A. E. Housman - Others, I Am Not the First<br />
<br />
Others, I am not the first,<br />
Have willed more mischief than they durst:<br />
If in the breathless night I too<br />
Shiver now, 'tis nothing new.<br />
<br />
More than I, if truth were told,<br />
Have stood and sweated hot and cold,<br />
And through their reins in ice and fire<br />
Fear contended with desire.<br />
<br />
Agued once like me were they,<br />
But I like them shall win my way<br />
Lastly to the bed of mould<br />
Where there's neither heat nor cold.<br />
<br />
But from my grave across my brow<br />
Plays no wind of healing now,<br />
And fire and ice within me fight<br />
Beneath the suffocating night.
