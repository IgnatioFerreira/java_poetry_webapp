A. E. Housman - Westward on the High-Hilled Plains<br />
<br />
Westward on the high-hilled plains<br />
Where for me the world began,<br />
Still, I think, in newer veins<br />
Frets the changeless blood of man.<br />
<br />
Now that other lads than I<br />
Strip to bathe on Severn shore,<br />
They, no help, for all they try,<br />
Tread the mill I trod before.<br />
<br />
There, when hueless is the west<br />
And the darkness hushes wide,<br />
Where the lad lies down to rest<br />
Stands the troubled dream beside.<br />
<br />
There, on thoughts that once were mine,<br />
Day looks down the eastern steep,<br />
And the youth at morning shine<br />
Makes the vow he will not keep.
