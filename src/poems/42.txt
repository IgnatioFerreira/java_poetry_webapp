A. E. Housman - Reveille<br />
<br />
Wake: the silver dusk returning<br />
    Up the beach of darkness brims,<br />
And the ship of sunrise burning<br />
    Strands upon the eastern rims.<br />
<br />
Wake: the vaulted shadow shatters,<br />
    Trampled to the floor it spanned,<br />
And the tent of night in tatters<br />
    Straws the sky-pavilioned land.<br />
<br />
Up, lad, up, 'tis late for lying:<br />
    Hear the drums of morning play;<br />
Hark, the empty highways crying<br />
    "Who'll beyond the hills away?"<br />
<br />
Towns and countries woo together,<br />
    Forelands beacon, belfries call;<br />
Never lad that trod on leather<br />
    Lived to feast his heart with all.<br />
<br />
Up, lad: thews that lie and cumber<br />
    Sunlit pallets never thrive;<br />
Morns abed and daylight slumber<br />
    Were not meant for man alive.<br />
<br />
Clay lies still, but blood's a rover;<br />
    Breath's a ware that will not keep.<br />
Up, lad: when the journey's over<br />
    There'll be time enough to sleep.
