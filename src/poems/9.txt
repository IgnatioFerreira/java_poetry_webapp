A. E. Housman - Eight O'Clock<br />
<br />
He stood, and heard the steeple<br />
Sprinkle the quarters on the morning town.<br />
One, two, three, four, to market-place and people<br />
It tossed them down.<br />
<br />
Strapped, noosed, nighing his hour,<br />
He stood and counted them and cursed his luck;<br />
And then the clock collected in the tower<br />
Its strength, and struck.
