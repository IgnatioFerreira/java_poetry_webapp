A. E. Housman - The Carpenter's Son<br />
<br />
"Here the hangman stops his cart:<br />
Now the best of friends must part.<br />
Fare you well, for ill fare I:<br />
Live, lads, and I will die.<br />
<br />
"Oh, at home had I but stayed<br />
'Prenticed to my father's trade,<br />
Had I stuck to plane and adze,<br />
I had not been lost, my lads.<br />
<br />
"Then I might have built perhaps<br />
Gallows-trees for other chaps,<br />
Never dangled on my own,<br />
Had I left but ill alone.<br />
<br />
"Now, you see, they hang me high,<br />
And the people passing by<br />
Stop to shake their fists and curse;<br />
So 'tis come from ill to worse.<br />
<br />
"Here hang I, and right and left<br />
Two poor fellows hang for theft:<br />
All the same's the luck we prove,<br />
Though the midmost hangs for love.<br />
<br />
"Comrades all, that stand and gaze,<br />
Walk henceforth in other ways;<br />
See my neck and save your own:<br />
Comrades all, leave ill alone.<br />
<br />
"Make some day a decent end,<br />
Shrewder fellows than your friend.<br />
Fare you well, for ill fare I:<br />
Live lads, and I will die."
