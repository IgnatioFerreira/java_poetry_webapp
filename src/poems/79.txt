A. E. Housman - When Smoke Stood Up From Ludlow<br />
<br />
When smoke stood up from Ludlow,<br />
And mist blew off from Teme,<br />
And blithe afield to ploughing<br />
Against the morning beam<br />
I strode beside my team,<br />
<br />
The blackbird in the coppice<br />
Looked out to see me stride,<br />
And hearkened as I whistled<br />
The trampling team beside,<br />
And fluted and replied:<br />
<br />
"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;<br />
What use to rise and rise?<br />
Rise man a thousand mornings<br />
Yet down at last he lies,<br />
And then the man is wise."<br />
<br />
I heard the tune he sang me,<br />
And spied his yellow bill;<br />
I picked a stone and aimed it<br />
And threw it with a will:<br />
Then the bird was still.<br />
<br />
Then my soul within me<br />
Took up the blackbird's strain,<br />
And still beside the horses<br />
Along the dewy lane<br />
It sang the song again:<br />
<br />
"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;<br />
The sun moves always west;<br />
The road one treads to labour<br />
Will lead one home to rest,<br />
And that will be the best."
