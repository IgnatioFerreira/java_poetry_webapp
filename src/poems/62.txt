A. E. Housman - The Recruit<br />
<br />
Leave your home behind, lad,<br />
And reach your friends your hand,<br />
And go, and luck go with you<br />
While Ludlow tower shall stand.<br />
<br />
Oh, come you home of Sunday<br />
When Ludlow streets are still<br />
And Ludlow bells are calling<br />
To farm and lane and mill,<br />
<br />
Or come you home of Monday<br />
When Ludlow market hums<br />
And Ludlow chimes are playing<br />
"The conquering hero comes,"<br />
<br />
Come you home a hero,<br />
Or come not home at all,<br />
The lads you leave will mind you<br />
Till Ludlow tower shall fall.<br />
<br />
And you will list the bugle<br />
That blows in lands of morn,<br />
And make the foes of England<br />
Be sorry you were born.<br />
<br />
And you till trump of doomsday<br />
On lands of morn may lie,<br />
And make the hearts of comrades<br />
Be heavy where you die.<br />
<br />
Leave your home behind you,<br />
Your friends by field and town:<br />
Oh, town and field will mind you<br />
Till Ludlow tower is down.
