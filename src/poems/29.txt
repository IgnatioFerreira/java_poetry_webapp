A. E. Housman - March<br />
<br />
The Sun at noon to higher air,<br />
Unharnessing the silver Pair<br />
That late before his chariot swam,<br />
Rides on the gold wool of the Ram.<br />
<br />
So braver notes the storm-cock sings<br />
To start the rusted wheel of things,<br />
And brutes in field and brutes in pen<br />
Leap that the world goes round again.<br />
<br />
The boys are up the woods with day<br />
To fetch the daffodils away,<br />
And home at noonday from the hills<br />
They bring no dearth of daffodils.<br />
<br />
Afield for palms the girls repair,<br />
And sure enough the palms are there,<br />
And each will find by hedge or pond<br />
Her waving silver-tufted wand.<br />
<br />
In farm and field through all the shire<br />
The eye beholds the heart's desire;<br />
Ah, let not only mine be vain,<br />
For lovers should be loved again.
