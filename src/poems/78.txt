A. E. Housman - When I Watch the Living Meet<br />
<br />
When I watch the living meet<br />
And the moving pageant file<br />
Warm and breathing through the street<br />
Where I lodge a little while,<br />
<br />
If the heats of hate and lust<br />
In the house of flesh are strong,<br />
Let me mind the house of dust<br />
Where my sojourn shall be long.<br />
<br />
In the nation that is not<br />
Nothing stands that stood before;<br />
There revenges are forgot,<br />
And the hater hates no more;<br />
<br />
Lovers lying two and two<br />
Ask not whom they sleep beside,<br />
And the bridegroom all night through<br />
Never turns him to the bride
