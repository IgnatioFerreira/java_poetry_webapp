A. E. Housman - The True Lover<br />
<br />
The lad came to the door at night,<br />
When lovers crown their vows,<br />
And whistled soft and out of sight<br />
In shadow of the boughs.<br />
<br />
"I shall not vex you with my face<br />
Henceforth, my love, for aye;<br />
So take me in your arms a space<br />
Before the cast is grey.<br />
<br />
"When I from hence away am past<br />
I shall not find a bride,<br />
And you shall be the first and last<br />
I ever lay beside."<br />
<br />
She heard and went and knew not why;<br />
Her heart to his she laid;<br />
Light was the air beneath the sky<br />
But dark under the shade.<br />
<br />
"Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast<br />
Seems not to rise and fall,<br />
And here upon my bosom prest<br />
There beats no heart at all?"<br />
<br />
"Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock,<br />
You should have felt it then;<br />
But since for you I stopped the clock<br />
It never goes again."<br />
<br />
"Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips<br />
Wet from your neck on mine?<br />
What is it falling on my lips,<br />
My lad, that tastes of brine?"<br />
<br />
"Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear,<br />
For when the knife was slit,<br />
The throat across from ear to ear<br />
'Twill bleed because of it."<br />
<br />
Under the stars the air was light<br />
But dark below the boughs,<br />
The still air of the speechless night,<br />
When lovers crown their vows.
