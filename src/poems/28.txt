A. E. Housman - Loveliest of Trees, the Cherry Now<br />
<br />
Loveliest of trees, the cherry now<br />
Is hung with bloom along the bough,<br />
And stands about the woodland ride<br />
Wearing white for Eastertide.<br />
<br />
Now, of my threescore years and ten,<br />
Twenty will not come again,<br />
And take from seventy springs a score,<br />
It only leaves me fifty more.<br />
<br />
And since to look at things in bloom<br />
Fifty springs are little room,<br />
About the woodlands I will go<br />
To see the cherry hung with snow.
