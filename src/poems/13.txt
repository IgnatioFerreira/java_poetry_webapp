A. E. Housman - Fragment of a Greek Tragedy<br />
<br />
CHORUS:  O suitably-attired-in-leather-boots<br />
         Head of a traveller, wherefore seeking whom<br />
         Whence by what way how purposed art thou come<br />
         To this well-nightingaled vicinity?<br />
         My object in inquiring is to know.<br />
         But if you happen to be deaf and dumb<br />
         And do not understand a word I say,<br />
         Then wave your hand, to signify as much.<br />
<br />
               ALCMAEON: I journeyed hither a Boetian road.<br />
               CHORUS: Sailing on horseback, or with feet for oars?<br />
               ALCMAEON: Plying with speed my partnership of legs.<br />
               CHORUS: Beneath a shining or a rainy Zeus?<br />
               ALCMAEON: Mud's sister, not himself, adorns my shoes.<br />
               CHORUS: To learn your name would not displease me much.<br />
               ALCMAEON: Not all that men desire do they obtain.<br />
               CHORUS: Might I then hear at what thy presence shoots.<br />
               ALCMAEON: A shepherd's questioned mouth informed me that--<br />
               CHORUS: What? for I know not yet what you will say.<br />
               ALCMAEON: Nor will you ever, if you interrupt.<br />
               CHORUS: Proceed, and I will hold my speechless tongue.<br />
               ALCMAEON: This house was Eriphyle's, no one else's.<br />
               CHORUS: Nor did he shame his throat with shameful lies.<br />
               ALCMAEON: May I then enter, passing through the door?<br />
               CHORUS: Go chase into the house a lucky foot.<br />
         And, O my son, be, on the one hand, good,<br />
         And do not, on the other hand, be bad;<br />
         For that is much the safest plan.<br />
               ALCMAEON: I go into the house with heels and speed.<br />
<br />
               CHORUS<br />
<br />
                        Strophe<br />
<br />
         In speculation<br />
         I would not willingly acquire a name<br />
               For ill-digested thought;<br />
               But after pondering much<br />
         To this conclusion I at last have come:<br />
               LIFE IS UNCERTAIN.<br />
               This truth I have written deep<br />
               In my reflective midriff<br />
               On tablets not of wax,<br />
         Nor with a pen did I inscribe it there,<br />
         For many reasons:  LIFE, I say, IS NOT<br />
               A STRANGER TO UNCERTAINTY.<br />
         Not from the flight of omen-yelling fowls<br />
               This fact did I discover,<br />
         Nor did the Delphine tripod bark it out,<br />
               Nor yet Dodona.<br />
         Its native ingunuity sufficed<br />
               My self-taught diaphragm.<br />
<br />
                      Antistrophe<br />
<br />
               Why should I mention<br />
         The Inachean daughter, loved of Zeus?<br />
               Her whom of old the gods,<br />
               More provident than kind,<br />
         Provided with four hoofs, two horns, one tail,<br />
               A gift not asked for,<br />
               And sent her forth to learn<br />
               The unfamiliar science<br />
               Of how to chew the cud.<br />
         She therefore, all about the Argive fields,<br />
         Went cropping pale green grass and nettle-tops,<br />
               Nor did they disagree with her.<br />
         But yet, howe'er nutritious, such repasts<br />
               I do not hanker after:<br />
         Never may Cypris for her seat select<br />
               My dappled liver!<br />
         Why should I mention Io?  Why indeed?<br />
               I have no notion why.<br />
<br />
                     Epode<br />
<br />
               But now does my boding heart,<br />
               Unhired, unaccompanied, sing<br />
               A strain not meet for the dance.<br />
               Yes even the palace appears<br />
               To my yoke of circular eyes<br />
               (The right, nor omit I the left)<br />
               Like a slaughterhouse, so to speak,<br />
               Garnished with woolly deaths<br />
               And many sphipwrecks of cows.<br />
         I therefore in a Cissian strain lament:<br />
               And to the rapid<br />
               Loud, linen-tattering thumps upon my chest<br />
               Resounds in concert<br />
         The battering of my unlucky head.<br />
<br />
               ERIPHYLE (within): O, I am smitten with a hatchet's jaw;<br />
         And that in deed and not in word alone.<br />
               CHORUS: I thought I heard a sound within the house<br />
         Unlike the voice of one that jumps for joy.<br />
               ERIPHYLE: He splits my skull, not in a friendly way,<br />
         Once more: he purposes to kill me dead.<br />
               CHORUS: I would not be reputed rash, but yet<br />
         I doubt if all be gay within the house.<br />
               ERIPHYLE: O! O! another stroke! that makes the third.<br />
         He stabs me to the heart against my wish.<br />
               CHORUS:  If that be so, thy state of health is poor;<br />
         But thine arithmetic is quite correct.
