A. E. Housman - Oh Stay At Home, My Lad<br />
<br />
Oh stay at home, my lad, and plough<br />
The land and not the sea,<br />
And leave the soldiers at their drill,<br />
And all about the idle hill<br />
Shepherd your sheep with me.<br />
<br />
Oh stay with company and mirth<br />
And daylight and the air;<br />
Too full already is the grave<br />
Of fellows that were good and brave<br />
And died because they were.
