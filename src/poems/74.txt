A. E. Housman - Wake Not for the World-Heard Thunder<br />
<br />
Wake not for the world-heard thunder,<br />
Nor the chimes that earthquakes toll;<br />
Stars may plot in heaven with planet,<br />
Lightning rive the rock of granite,<br />
Tempest tread the oakwood under,<br />
Fear not you for flesh or soul;<br />
Marching, fighting, victory past,<br />
Stretch your limbs in peace at last.<br />
<br />
Stir not for the soldier's drilling,<br />
Nor the fever nothing cures;<br />
Throb of drum and timbal's rattle<br />
Call but men alive to battle,<br />
And the fife with death-notes filling<br />
Screams for blood--but not for yours.<br />
Times enough you bled your best;<br />
Sleep on now, and take your rest.<br />
<br />
Sleep, my lad; the French have landed,<br />
London's burning, Windsor's down.<br />
Clasp your cloak of earth about you;<br />
We must man the ditch without you,<br />
March unled and fight short-handed,<br />
Charge to fall and swim to drown.<br />
Duty, friendship, bravery o'er,<br />
Sleep away, lad; wake no more.
