A. E. Housman - If By Chance Your Eye Offend You<br />
<br />
If by chance your eye offend you,<br />
Pluck it out, lad, and be sound:<br />
'Twill hurt, but here are salves to friend you,<br />
And many a balsam grows on ground.<br />
<br />
And if your hand or foot offend you,<br />
Cut it off, lad, and be whole;<br />
But play the man, stand up and end you,<br />
When your sickness is your soul.
