A. E. Housman - Hughley Steeple<br />
<br />
The vane on Hughley steeple<br />
Veers bright, a far-known sign,<br />
And there lie Hughley people<br />
And there lie friends of mine.<br />
Tall in their midst the tower<br />
Divides the shade and sun,<br />
And the clock strikes the hour<br />
And tells the time to none.<br />
<br />
To south the headstones cluster,<br />
The sunny mounds lie thick;<br />
The dead are more in muster<br />
At Hughley than the quick.<br />
North, for a soon-told number,<br />
Chill graves the sexton delves,<br />
And steeple-shadowed slumber<br />
The slayers of themselves.<br />
<br />
To north, to south, lie parted,<br />
With Hughley tower above,<br />
The kind, the single-hearted,<br />
The lads I used to love.<br />
And, south or north, 'tis only<br />
A choice of friends one knows,<br />
And I shall ne'er be lonely<br />
Asleep with these or those.
