A. E. Housman - It Nods and Curtseys and Recovers<br />
<br />
It nods and curtsey's and recovers<br />
When the wind blows above,<br />
The nettle on the graves of lovers<br />
That hanged themselves for love.<br />
<br />
The nettle nods, the wind blows over,<br />
The man, he does not move,<br />
The lover of the grave, the lover<br />
That hanged himself for love.
