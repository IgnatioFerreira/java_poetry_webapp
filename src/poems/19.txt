A. E. Housman - If Truth in Hearts That Perish<br />
<br />
If truth in hearts that perish<br />
Could move the powers on high,<br />
I think the love I bear you<br />
Should make you not to die.<br />
<br />
Sure, sure, if steadfast meaning,<br />
If single thought could save,<br />
The world might end to-morrow,<br />
You should not see the grave.<br />
<br />
This long and sure-set liking,<br />
This boundless will to please,<br />
--Oh, you should live for ever,<br />
If there were help in these.<br />
<br />
But now, since all is idle,<br />
To this lost heart be kind,<br />
Ere to a town you journey<br />
Where friends are ill to find.
