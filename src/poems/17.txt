A. E. Housman - I Hoed and Trenched and Weeded<br />
<br />
I hoed and trenched and weeded,<br />
And took the flowers to fair:<br />
I brought them home unheeded;<br />
The hue was not the wear.<br />
<br />
So up and down I sow them<br />
For lads like me to find,<br />
When I shall lie below them,<br />
A dead man out of mind.<br />
<br />
Some seed the birds devour,<br />
And some the season mars,<br />
But here and there will flower,<br />
The solitary stars,<br />
<br />
And fields will yearly bear them<br />
As light-leaved spring comes on,<br />
And luckless lads will wear them<br />
When I am dead and gone.
