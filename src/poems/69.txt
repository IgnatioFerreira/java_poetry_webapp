A. E. Housman - Think No More, Lad<br />
<br />
Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly:<br />
Why should men make haste to die?<br />
Empty heads and tongues a-talking<br />
Make the rough road easy walking,<br />
And the feather pate of folly<br />
Bears the falling sky.<br />
<br />
Oh, 'tis jesting, dancing, drinking<br />
Spins the heavy world around.<br />
If young hearts were not so clever,<br />
Oh, they would be young for ever:<br />
Think no more; 'tis only thinking<br />
Lays lads underground.
