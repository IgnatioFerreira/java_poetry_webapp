A. E. Housman - From Far, From Eve and Morning<br />
<br />
From far, from eve and morning<br />
And yon twelve-winded sky,<br />
The stuff of life to knit me<br />
Blew hither: here am I.<br />
<br />
Now-- for a breath I tarry<br />
Nor yet disperse apart--<br />
Take my hand quick and tell me,<br />
What have you in your heart.<br />
<br />
Speak now, and I will answer;<br />
How shall I help you, say;<br />
Ere to the wind's twelve quarters<br />
I take my endless way.
