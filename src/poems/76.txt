A. E. Housman - When I Came Last to Ludlow<br />
<br />
When I came last to Ludlow<br />
Amidst the moonlight pale,<br />
Two friends kept step beside me,<br />
Two honest friends and hale.<br />
<br />
Now Dick lies long in the churchyard,<br />
And Ned lies long in jail,<br />
And I come home to Ludlow<br />
Amidst the moonlight pale.
