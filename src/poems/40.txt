A. E. Housman - On Your Midnight Pallet Lying<br />
<br />
On your midnight pallet lying,<br />
Listen, and undo the door:<br />
Lads that waste the light in sighing<br />
In the dark should sigh no more;<br />
Night should ease a lover's sorrow;<br />
Therefore, since I go to-morrow,<br />
Pity me before.<br />
<br />
In the land to which I travel,<br />
The far dwelling, let me say--<br />
Once, if here the couch is gravel,<br />
In a kinder bed I lay,<br />
And the breast the darnel smothers<br />
Rested once upon another's<br />
When it was not clay.
