A. E. Housman - Ho, everyone that thirsteth<br />
<br />
Ho, everyone that thirsteth<br />
And hath the price to give,<br />
Come to the stolen waters,<br />
Drink and your soul shall live.<br />
<br />
Come to the stolen waters,<br />
And leap the guarded pale,<br />
And pull the flower in season<br />
Before desire shall fail.<br />
<br />
It shall not last for ever,<br />
No more than earth and skies;<br />
But he that drinks in season<br />
Shall live before he dies.<br />
<br />
June suns, you cannot store them<br />
To warm the winter's cold,<br />
The lad that hopes for heaven<br />
Shall fill his mouth with mold.
