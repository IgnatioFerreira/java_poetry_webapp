A. E. Housman - Now Hollow Fires Burn Out to Black<br />
<br />
Now hollow fires burn out to black,<br />
And lights are guttering low:<br />
Square your shoulders, lift your pack,<br />
And leave your friends and go.<br />
<br />
Oh never fear, man, nought's to dread,<br />
Look not to left nor right:<br />
In all the endless road you tread<br />
There's nothing but the night.
