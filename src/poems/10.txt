A. E. Housman - Epitaph On An Army of Mercenaries<br />
<br />
These, in the day when heaven was falling,<br />
The hour when earth's foundations fled,<br />
Followed their mercenary calling<br />
And took their wages and are dead.<br />
<br />
Their shoulders held the sky suspended;<br />
They stood, and earth's foundations stay;<br />
What God abandoned, these defended,<br />
And saved the sum of things for pay.
