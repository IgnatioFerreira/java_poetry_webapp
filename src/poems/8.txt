A. E. Housman - Diffugere Nives<br />
<br />
Horace, Odes, iv, 7<br />
<br />
The snows are fled away, leaves on the shaws<br />
And grasses in the mead renew their birth,<br />
The river to the river-bed withdraws,<br />
And altered is the fashion of the earth.<br />
<br />
The Nymphs and Graces three put off their fear<br />
And unapparelled in the woodland play.<br />
The swift hour and the brief prime of the year<br />
Say to the soul, Thou wast not born for aye.<br />
<br />
Thaw follows frost; hard on the heel of spring<br />
Treads summer sure to die, for hard on hers<br />
Comes autumn with his apples scattering;<br />
Then back to wintertide, when nothing stirs.<br />
<br />
But oh, whate'er the sky-led seasons mar,<br />
Moon upon moon rebuilds it with her beams;<br />
Come we where Tullus and where Ancus are<br />
And good Aeneas, we are dust and dreams.<br />
<br />
Torquatus, if the gods in heaven shall add<br />
The morrow to the day, what tongue has told?<br />
Feast then thy heart, for what thy heart has had<br />
The fingers of no heir will ever hold.<br />
<br />
When thou descendest once the shades among,<br />
The stern assize and equal judgment o'er,<br />
Not thy long lineage nor thy golden tongue,<br />
No, nor thy righteousness, shall friend thee more.<br />
<br />
Night holds Hippolytus the pure of stain,<br />
Diana steads him nothing, he must stay;<br />
And Theseus leafves Pirithous in the chain<br />
The love of comrades cannot take away.
