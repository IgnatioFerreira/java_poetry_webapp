A. E. Housman - Twice a Week the Winter Thorough<br />
<br />
Twice a week the winter thorough<br />
Here stood I to keep the goal:<br />
Football then was fighting sorrow<br />
For the young man's soul.<br />
<br />
Now in Maytime to the wicket<br />
Out I march with bat and pad:<br />
See the son of grief at cricket<br />
Trying to be glad.<br />
<br />
Try I will; no harm in trying:<br />
Wonder 'tis how little mirth<br />
Keeps the bones of man from lying<br />
On the bed of earth.
