A. E. Housman - You Smile Upon Your Friend To-Day<br />
<br />
You smile upon your friend to-day,<br />
To-day his ills are over;<br />
You hearken to the lover's say,<br />
And happy is the lover.<br />
<br />
'Tis late to hearken, late to smile,<br />
But better late than never;<br />
I shall have lived a little while<br />
Before I die for ever.
