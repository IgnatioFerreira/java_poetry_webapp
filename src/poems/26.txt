A. E. Housman - Look not in my eyes, for fear<br />
<br />
Look not in my eyes, for fear<br />
  Thy mirror true the sight I see,<br />
And there you find your face too clear<br />
  And love it and be lost like me.<br />
One the long nights through must lie<br />
  Spent in star-defeated sighs,<br />
But why should you as well as I<br />
  Perish? gaze not in my eyes.<br />
<br />
A Grecian lad, as I hear tell,<br />
  One that many loved in vain,<br />
Looked into a forest well<br />
  And never looked away again.<br />
There, when the turf in springtime flowers,<br />
  With downward eye and gazes sad,<br />
Stands amid the glancing showers<br />
  A jonquil, not a Grecian lad.
