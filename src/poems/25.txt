A. E. Housman - Loitering with a Vacant Eye<br />
<br />
Loitering with a vacant eye<br />
Along the Grecian gallery,<br />
And brooding on my heavy ill,<br />
I met a statue standing still.<br />
Still in marble stone stood he,<br />
And stedfastly he looked at me.<br />
"Well met," I thought the look would say,<br />
"We both were fashioned far away;<br />
We neither knew, when we were young,<br />
These Londoners we live among."<br />
<br />
Still he stood and eyed me hard,<br />
An earnest and a grave regard:<br />
"What, lad, drooping with your lot?<br />
I too would be where I am not.<br />
I too survey that endless line<br />
Of men whose thoughts are not as mine.<br />
Years, ere you stood up from rest,<br />
On my neck the collar prest;<br />
Years, when you lay down your ill,<br />
I shall stand and bear it still.<br />
Courage, lad, 'tis not for long:<br />
Stand, quit you like stone, be strong."<br />
So I thought his look would say;<br />
And light on me my trouble lay,<br />
And I stept out in flesh and bone<br />
Manful like the man of stone.
