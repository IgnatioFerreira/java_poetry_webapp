A. E. Housman - On the Idle Hill of Summer<br />
<br />
On the idle hill of summer,<br />
  Sleepy with the flow of streams,<br />
Far I hear the steady drummer<br />
  Drumming like a noise in dreams.<br />
<br />
Far and near and low and louder<br />
  On the roads of earth go by,<br />
Dear to friends and food for powder,<br />
  Soldiers marching, all to die.<br />
<br />
East and west on fields forgotten<br />
  Bleach the bones of comrades slain,<br />
Lovely lads and dead and rotten;<br />
  None that go return again.<br />
<br />
Far the calling bugles hollo,<br />
  High the screaming fife replies,<br />
Gay the files of scarlet follow:<br />
  Woman bore me, I will rise.
