A. E. Housman - Oh Who Is That Young Sinner<br />
<br />
Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?<br />
And what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists?<br />
And wherefore is he wearing such a conscience-stricken air?<br />
Oh they're taking him to prison for the color of his hair.<br />
<br />
'Tis a shame to human nature, such a head of hair as his;<br />
In the good old time 'twas hanging for the color that it is;<br />
Though hanging isn't bad enough and flaying would be fair<br />
For the nameless and abominable color of his hair.<br />
<br />
Oh a deal of pains he's taken and a pretty price he's paid<br />
To hide his poll or dye it of a mentionable shade;<br />
But they've pulled the beggar's hat off for the world to see and stare,<br />
And they're taking him to justice for the color of his hair.<br />
<br />
Now 'tis oakum for his fingers and the treadmill for his feet,<br />
And the quarry-gang on Portland in the cold and in the heat,<br />
And between his spells of labor in the time he has to spare<br />
He can curse the God that made him for the color of his hair.
